So the challenge is to get the maximun Gil in treasure in this mode in a 30 minutes timespam.
</p><p>
Sounds simple correct. So let's make it more interesting:
</p><p>
-Every boss defeated counts as 100000G (optional rule).</p><p>
-If the 30 minutes mark and the challenger is on a save room, her/his score multiplies by 1.25</p><p>
-If the challenger manage to defeat Wham Bam Rock (not finish it the mode, just defeating the boss) in the time slot, his/her score multiplies by 2</p><p>
</p><p>
As soon as the 30 minute mark happen, the player should pause their game and look for the G gained with the treasures. </p><p>
If they defeat the mode they use the score showed in the credits, and make al the calculations."</p>
